    <string name="faq_label">Frequently asked questions</string>
    <string name="background_working_label">The app doesn\'t work in background</string>
    <string name="background_working_faq_label">Due to Android restrictions, we can\'t guarantee that app will be able to always work in background. Ensure that this app is allowed to run in background (Settings - Apps). Disable battery saver mode.</string>
    <string name="last_known_location_not_sent_label">The app doesn\'t send last known location</string>
    <string name="last_known_location_not_sent_faq_label">The app can send last known location only if the system can provide it. If Android can\'t provide the last known location (for example, because you has GPS disabled for a long time), the app won\'t send anything.</string>
    <string name="location_permission_label">How does this app use location permission?</string>
    <string name="location_permission_faq_label">The app uses it to get the location after receiving an appropriate incoming SMS.</string>
    <string name="sms_permission_label">How does this app use SMS permission?</string>
    <string name="sms_permission_faq_label">The app reads all the incoming SMS to check if it needs to send location as a reply. It doesn\'t store or process your SMS messages in any other way.</string>
    <string name="contacts_permission_label">How does this app use contacts permission?</string>
    <string name="contacts_permission_faq_label">This permission is not necessary. You can provide it to use contact picker when creating a new item. If you don\'t provide it, you still will be able to enter the number by yourselves.</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_label">Privacy policy</string>
    <string name="privacy_policy_faq_label">The app doesn\'t collect any data. Google Location services are used for location requests. Their use is regulated by <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</string>
