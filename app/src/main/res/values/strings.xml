    <string name="background_working_faq_label">Due to Android restrictions, we can\'t guarantee that app will be able to always work in background. Try not to remove it from recent apps list. Ensure that this app is allowed to run in background (Settings - Apps). Disable battery saver mode.</string>

    <string name="last_known_location_not_sent_faq_label">The app can send last known location only if the system can provide it. If Android can\'t provide the last known location (for example, because you has GPS disabled for a long time), the app won\'t send anything.</string>
